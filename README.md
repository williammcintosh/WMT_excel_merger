# Excel Merger

This project is designed to merge multiple Excel files and generate logs for the process. It takes in the user's input for both the year and the month of interest, then for that month and year combo will locate the correct sheet (tab), column, and row. Then, it will take that value and place it into a formula to incrementally increase the correct cell value sheet (tab), column, and row into what we in the Waste Minimization Team at the Port of Portland call the "Mastersheet".
